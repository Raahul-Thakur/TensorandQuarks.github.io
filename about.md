Hi, I'm Rahul, 
This blog explores physics and machine learning from an enthusiast’s lens.

Welcome to *Tensors & Quarks* — my digital notebook where I explore the elegant equations behind the universe and the powerful algorithms driving modern AI. With a background in physics and a passion for data, I often find myself fascinated by how the logic of the cosmos mirrors the structure of deep learning systems.

This blog serves as a space to document what I’m learning, building, and thinking — from breakdowns of cutting-edge research papers to tutorials, project writeups, and thought experiments at the intersection of science and code.

Whether you're an ML researcher, a physicist, a student, or just a fellow curious soul, I hope you find something here that sparks your imagination.

Let’s decode the fabric of reality, one post at a time

Currently working on:  
- Building ML-powered simulations  
- Reading about Cutting Edge Researchin both Astrophysics and AI  
- Blogging weekly on ML, space, and scientific creativity
