      <p><h1 id="will-we-colonise-mars-in-the-next-50-years">Will We Colonise Mars in the Next 50 Years?</h1>

<hr />

<p>This was my assignment for a university coursework module, where I was tasked to evaluate the likelihood of humans colonising Mars within the next 50 years. As someone fascinated by space exploration and future technologies, this topic struck a chord with me. What began as a research task soon turned into a deep dive into the science, speculation, and possibilities surrounding Mars colonisation. Here’s what I found.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-curious-neighbour-getting-to-know-mars">A Curious Neighbour: Getting to Know Mars</h2>

<p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a rocky world about half the size of Earth. Its thin atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, makes it a challenging environment for human life. The surface is dry, dusty, and subject to extreme temperatures—ranging from -125°C at night to about 20°C during the day near the equator.</p>

<p>Despite its harshness, Mars has some Earth-like features. It has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, and valleys. It also has a 24.6-hour day, making it surprisingly compatible with human circadian rhythms. These attributes make Mars a more appealing target for colonisation compared to any other planet in our Solar System.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="life-on-mars-a-question-of-the-past">Life on Mars: A Question of the Past?</h2>

<p>The search for life on Mars dates back decades. In 1996, NASA scientists led by Dr. David McKay made headlines when they claimed to have found fossilised microbial life in a Martian meteorite, ALH84001, discovered in Antarctica. While the claim was later contested and attributed to Earth-based contamination, it reignited global interest in Mars’s potential to support life.</p>

<p>We now know that Mars once had a much wetter and possibly warmer climate. Ancient riverbeds and sedimentary rocks point to the presence of water, which is crucial for life as we know it. Although the Viking missions of the 1970s found no direct evidence of life, newer rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance continue to search for biosignatures and habitable environments beneath the Martian surface.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-even-think-about-colonising-mars">Why Even Think About Colonising Mars?</h2>

<p>The idea of colonising Mars is not just the stuff of science fiction—it has practical motivations. One key reason is <strong>planetary redundancy</strong>: ensuring the survival of the human species in case Earth becomes uninhabitable due to climate change, war, or asteroid impact.</p>

<p>Additionally, Mars holds the potential for resource extraction, scientific advancement, and deep space exploration. It is rich in minerals, and there is strong evidence of subglacial water ice. With enough technological support, this water could be used for drinking, farming, and even fuel production—via hydrogen extraction. Mars also inspires us to push the boundaries of what humanity is capable of.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="whos-leading-the-charge">Who’s Leading the Charge?</h2>

<p>At the forefront of the Mars mission is <strong>SpaceX</strong>, with founder Elon Musk envisioning a self-sustaining city of 1 million people on the planet by 2050. His company’s <em>Starship</em> rocket is designed specifically for long-distance space travel and cargo transport. Successful tests of orbital flights are expected in the coming years.</p>

<p>NASA is also working toward a human mission to Mars, targeting the late 2030s. Its Artemis program—focused on returning humans to the Moon—will act as a stepping stone for Mars expeditions. Meanwhile, the <strong>European Space Agency (ESA)</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> have proposed missions that could send humans to Mars sometime between 2040 and 2045.</p>

<p>In parallel, robotic missions continue to pave the way. The ESA’s <em>ExoMars</em> rover, delayed due to global events, aims to drill into the Martian crust to search for signs of past life. Private-public partnerships are becoming increasingly vital, with firms like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and United Launch Alliance contributing to launch systems and infrastructure development.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-glimpse-at-the-mars-colonisation-timeline">A Glimpse at the Mars Colonisation Timeline</h2>

<p>Based on current ambitions, here’s a speculative—but optimistic—timeline for how a Mars colony might unfold:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Late 2020s</strong>: SpaceX’s <em>Starship</em> achieves reliable orbital test flights. Robotic missions begin preparing infrastructure at proposed Mars base locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Early 2030s</strong>: NASA and SpaceX coordinate initial cargo deliveries to Mars Base Alpha—solar arrays, nuclear reactors, and supply modules.</li>
  <li><strong>Mid-2030s</strong>: First crewed mission lands on Mars. A small team of astronauts begins building modular habitats and testing life-support systems.</li>
  <li><strong>2040s</strong>: Greenhouses are set up for local food production. Ice mining for water begins. Additional crews increase the base population to over 100 people.</li>
  <li><strong>2050</strong>: A semi-permanent Martian outpost is established with a population of 150–200 residents. Heavy-duty equipment arrives for deeper construction, and international collaborations begin to support Martian research and expansion.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="but-whats-holding-us-back">But… What’s Holding Us Back?</h2>

<p>While this timeline is hopeful, many challenges remain. The thin atmosphere offers no protection from <strong>cosmic radiation</strong>, making it unsafe for prolonged surface exposure without shielding. <strong>Psychological effects</strong> of isolation, confinement, and communication delays (up to 22 minutes each way) could affect astronaut health.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <strong>sourcing water</strong> from Martian ice requires new drilling and purification tech. Closed-loop life support systems need to be flawless, recycling air, water, and waste continuously. And let’s not forget the economics—there’s little to no <strong>profit</strong> in Mars colonisation at the moment, making it largely dependent on government grants and billionaire visionaries.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-verdict-will-we-get-there">The Verdict: Will We Get There?</h2>

<p>So, will humans <strong>colonise</strong> Mars in the next 50 years?</p>

<p>We are likely to see <strong>the first crewed missions, small outposts, and basic infrastructure</strong> on Mars within that time frame. But a fully-fledged colony with thriving Martian cities? That may take longer. The groundwork is being laid, and momentum is building—but much depends on how quickly we overcome the scientific, logistical, and psychological barriers ahead.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Colonising Mars is not just a scientific endeavour—it’s a bold extension of human curiosity and resilience. It’s about venturing into the unknown, forging a second home for our species, and testing the limits of what’s possible.</p>

<p>Whether or not we succeed by 2075, one thing is certain: the journey to Mars has already begun.</p>

<hr />

<p>For centuries, humanity has observed the Sun — tracking sunspots, solar flares, and cycles of activity. Telescopes, space observatories, and satellites have offered remarkable insights into our star’s behavior. Yet, an entire region of the Sun remains practically unexplored: its poles. The paper titled <em>“Exploring the Solar Poles: The Last Great Frontier of the Sun”</em> (Nandy et al., 2023) sets out to emphasize just how critical this overlooked region is to understanding the inner workings of our star. The authors argue that the solar poles hold vital clues to the Sun’s magnetic field generation, its cycle, and the behavior of space weather.</p>

<h2 id="the-astronomers-new-toolbox">The Astronomer’s New Toolbox</h2>

<p>Modern astronomy has evolved into a data-driven science. With massive sky surveys like SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), Pan-STARRS, and the upcoming LSST producing petabytes of data, traditional approaches no 
longer suffice. Manual inspection and simplistic models simply can’t scale with this astronomical data deluge. Enter <strong>astroML</strong>, a library that bridges the gap between astronomy and modern machine learning. 
astroML is a Python-based library built on top of familiar scientific computing tools like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. But what sets it apart is its thoughtful design — tailored to real-world 
astronomical problems. From irregular time series to galaxy classification, astroML brings statistically sound and domain-specific tools to the fingertips of astronomers, physicists, and data scientists alike.</p>

Published in 2017 by Vaswani et al., the paper <strong>“Attention Is All You Need”</strong> introduced the world to the <strong>Transformer</strong> architecture. This seemingly simple idea — that attention mechanisms alone can model 
complex language patterns without relying on recurrence or convolutions — has since become the bedrock of nearly every major NLP system.</p>

<p>On February 23, 1987, astronomers witnessed something extraordinary. A massive blue supergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud went supernova. Its light was dazzling, but for physicists, the real treasure arrived 
hours earlier—in the form of 19 ghostly signals captured by two underground neutrino detectors. This was <strong>Supernova 1987A</strong>, the closest observed supernova in nearly four centuries and the first ever accompanied
by direct neutrino detections. These few dozen elusive particles validated decades of theoretical work in core-collapse physics and marked the beginning of what we now call multi-messenger astronomy.</p>

<p>Yet, more than 35 years later, our best simulations—armed with full general relativity, detailed microphysics, and modern computing power—still <strong>cannot reproduce what those neutrino detectors saw</strong> in 1987.</p>

<p>Tensors are fundamental mathematical objects that appear across various domains such as physics, computer science, and engineering. At their core, tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that generalize the 
concepts of scalars (single numbers), vectors (one-dimensional arrays), and matrices (two-dimensional arrays). Unlike simple arrays, tensors are not just containers of numbers—they come with transformation 
rules that allow them to describe physical phenomena in a way that remains consistent across coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation, summarization, and translation. Yet, as powerful as they are, 
these models often struggle when asked to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require deliberate planning and interaction with external information sources. Traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting enables LLMs to articulate intermediate reasoning steps, but it remains confined to the model’s internal knowledge and inference capabilities. Conversely, action-based approaches have allowed 
models to execute external operations—such as querying an API or navigating an environment—but lack explicit internal reasoning, leading to unexplainable or brittle behavior. The ReAct framework addresses 
this gap by synergizing reasoning and acting in a unified prompt-based paradigm that interleaves “thoughts” and “actions” to solve complex tasks more effectively and transparently.</p>
